  #### Overall Story
  As a developer, I have been commissioned to create an application where a user can see herbs that could be used as holistic remedies or treatments. As a user, I can see a list of herbs. I can click on an herb and see more information about that herb. As a user, I can create an account and log in to the application. If I am logged in, I can add an herb to the list. As a logged in user, I can see a list of all the herbs as well as just the herbs I added. If my work is acceptable to my client, I may also be asked to add the ability to remove and update an herb from the list.
